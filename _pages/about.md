I am a Ph.D. student in Informatics at the [Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering](https://luddy.indiana.edu/about/index.html) at [Indiana University, Bloomington (IU)](https://www.iu.edu/index.html), under the supervision of [Prof. Jisun An](https://jisun.me/) and [Prof. Haewoon Kwak](https://haewoon.github.io/). 

My research covers three areas: (1) the collective behavior, decision-making, and collaboration of AI agents; (2) AI-human alignment and (3) computational social science with large language models (LLMs). I aim to develop AI systems that are safe, fair, and aligned with human social values by leveraging computer science, social science, statistical methods and large-scale data. My recent works focus on:

<ul>
  <li>Enhance the AI-human alignment in collective decision making and collaboration.</li>
  <li>Improve AI-human alignment by deepening the understanding of human belief systems using large-scale data.</li>
  <li>Identify and investigate strategies to mitigate potential biases in LLMs.</li>
</ul>

Prior to joining IU, I obtained a Ph.D. in Political Science and an M.S. in Data Science from the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/), where my M.S. study was supervised by [Prof. Jiebo Luo](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/jluo/). I also obtained my M.A. in Public Policy from the [University of Chicago](https://harris.uchicago.edu/) and B.A. in Economics from [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/).
